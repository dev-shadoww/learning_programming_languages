## The Role Of Algorithms In Computing

An `algorithm` is any well-deûned computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a ûnite amount of time.

An input is called as `instance` of problem.

An algorithm for a computational problem is correct if, for every problem instance provided as input, it halts finishes its computing in finite time and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance. A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem.
