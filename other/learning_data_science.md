# Learning Data Science

## Introduction

### Difference between Analysis and Analytics

There is huge chunk of data, so to study it we first split into sub chunks, and then perform `Analysis`, it is done on the things that have already happened.

Whereas `Analytics` tries to predict future events, This can be subdivided into,

- `Qualitative Analytics`, Using the intuition and analysis.
- `Quantitative Analytics`, Using the formulae and algorithms.

### Business Analytics, Data Analytics and Data Science

Data Science is discipline reliant on data availability, while business analytics does not completely rely on data.

Business Analytics includes `Business Case Studies`, `Qualitative Analytics`, whereas Data Science includes `Preliminary Data Report` and `Sales Forecasting`.

Business Intelligence is the process of analyzing and reporting historical business data, it is preliminary step of predictive analytics, it includes `Reporting With Visuals`, `Creating Dashboards`.

Machine learning is the ability of the machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed.

Artificial Intelligence simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers.

## Traditional Data Processing

In this we have `raw data` which then needs be `processed` to get `information` out of it.

Techniques includes such as `class labelling`, `data cleansing`, `dealing with missing values`, specific techniques are, `balancing`, `shuffling`.

It includes `numerical data` and `categorical data`.

## Big Data Processing

Big Data includes many more categories of data such as images, sounds, mobile data etcetera.

Techniques includes such as `class labelling`, `data cleansing`, `dealing with missing values`, `text data mining`, `data masking`.

## Business Intelligence

It includes process such as `observation`, `quantification`, `measures`, it then leads to `metrics` it includes measures + business meaning.

It also include `KPI`, `Dashboards`, `Reports`.

## Traditional Methods

Assess potential future scenarios by using advanced statistical methods.

Techniques involved are `Regressions`, `Logistic Regressions`, `clusters`, `Factor Analysis`, `Time Series`.

## Machine Learning

Creating an algorithm, which a computer then uses to find a model, that fits the data as best as possible.

Types are `Supervised Learning`, `Unsupervised Learning`, `Reinforcement Learning`.
