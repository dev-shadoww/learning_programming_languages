# Learning Machine Learning

## introduction

Creating an algorithm, which a computer then uses to find a model, that fits the data as best as possible.

The steps are

- Preprocessing
- Modelling
- Evaluation

The data sets need to be separated into `Training` set and `Test` set, the training set is used to create the model and then it is applied to test set.

### Feature Scaling

- Normalization

x\_ = (X - XMin) / (XMax - XMin)

- Standardization

x\_ = (X - miu) / sigma

It is applied to columns and not rows.
